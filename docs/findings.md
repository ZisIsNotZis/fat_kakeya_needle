# Findings — fat Kakeya needle, free 2D motion

One-line problem: minimize the area of the set swept by a 1×ε rectangle
turning 180° with unrestricted planar motion (translation + rotation).

## Theoretical ground truth (SOTA, from literature)

- Thin needle (ε→0), unconstrained region: infimum area = 0
  (Besicovitch 1928; regions can be arbitrarily small).
- Fat needle 1×ε: minimum swept area is Θ(1/log(1/ε)).
  Lower bound: Bourgain/Córdoba (δ-neighborhood of any Besicovitch set
  has area ≳ 1/log(1/δ)). Matching upper bound: Keich 1999 (Perron-tree
  constructions; no Besicovitch set of n triangles beats ~1/log n).
- The multiplicative constant in front of 1/log(1/ε) is **open** — this
  is what the numerical experiment probes.
- Optimal constructions (Perron trees, Pál joins) live inside a bounded
  region (~unit disk): they use MANY overlapping rotation stations
  (K ~ log(1/ε)), NOT travel to infinity. Moving far away adds area.
- Fixed-center rotation reference: π/4 ≈ 0.785 (disk of radius ½).
- Scaling: f(ε) = ε²·f(1/ε) for ε > 1 (similarity argument, exact) —
  so ε ∈ (0,1] covers the whole problem.

## Numerical setup (what we optimize)

Motion = keyframes (θᵢ, xᵢ, yᵢ), θ monotone 0→π/2, second half of the
turn = x-mirror of the first (mirror closure, exact). Between keyframes
poses interpolate linearly. Swept set = exact union of oriented-box
polygons (shapely), area computed exactly at any distance. v2
(`sweeper_v2.py`) parametrizes translations in signed log space
(center = σ(e^z − 1), σ = max(1, 8ε)) so exponential reach costs
O(log) parameters. Search: differential evolution + Nelder-Mead polish.

## Measured results (best-known f̂(ε), min over independent seeds)

| ε | f̂ | note |
|---|---|---|
| 0.8 | 1.252 | > π/4: sliding hurts fat needles (crossover ~ε=0.25) |
| 0.5 | 0.957 | |
| 0.3 | 0.828 | |
| 0.2 | 0.742 | |
| 0.1 | 0.590 | |
| 0.05 | 0.461 | best over 4 seeds; seed spread 0.46–0.67 |
| 0.035 | 0.438 | continuation pass 2 |
| 0.01 | 0.344 | best of 3 seeds; spread 0.34–0.42 |

- On [0.035, 0.8] the sampled curve fits power law ε^0.32 far better
  than A/(log(1/ε)+B). The log asymptotic has NOT set in by ε = 0.01:
  f̂·ln(1/ε) = 1.38 (ε=0.05) → 1.47 (ε=0.035) → 1.58 (ε=0.01), still
  rising. Both the pre-asymptotic regime and optimizer under-
  convergence are live explanations (see methodology).
- Sampled f̂ is smooth/monotone in ε (continuity hypothesis confirmed
  at ~5% level); 3 sampling strategies (independent sweep, warm
  continuation, batch-min) agree within noise on [0.08, 0.8].
- Seed variance is the dominant error source at small ε: identical
  configs differ up to 46% across RNG streams; good basins are found
  in ~1 of 3–4 seeds. Estimator must be min-over-seeds.
- K (keyframe count) study at ε=0.05: min-area K=6 (0.461) < K=10
  (0.583) < K=14 (0.608) — blind DE degrades with more parameters;
  extra stations only help with structure-aware initialization.
- Structure-seeded DE (Pál-join/Perron pivot-chain seeds, `seed_lib.py`):
  **negative result.** Geometric analysis shows endpoint-pivot fans
  sweep quarter-sectors (~0.15–0.33/segment) and inter-pivot slides add
  ε per line change — the fan gets WORSE with K (0.74 @K=4 → 1.58
  @K=16), opposite to the intended 1/log behavior; all parameterized
  pivot-profile seeds collapse to the fixed-center disk (≈0.784).
  Controlled A/B (same budget, same RNG): seeded-init DE 0.463 vs
  random-init 0.461 — a tie. Conclusion: the good basin DE finds is
  NOT the classical pivot-chain family; the uniform-θ keyframe model
  with interpolated poses cannot faithfully express Perron-tree
  triangle-overlap packing. A faithful test of the construction family
  needs a pivot+slide segment representation (open).

## Open questions

1. Does f̂·ln(1/ε) flatten (log law, constant A) below ε = 0.01, or
   does the measured curve keep its power-law character? Needs both
   smaller ε and better search at fixed ε.
2. ~~Structure-seeded initialization~~ — tested, negative result (see
   findings above). The successor question: does a **pivot+slide
   segment representation** (each keyframe interval = rotate about a
   chosen cross-section point, then slide along the needle), which can
   faithfully express Perron-tree packing, find areas the keyframe-
   interpolation model cannot?
3. Sharp A for the true optimum: theory gives no candidate value.
4. Seed-farm: min over N≥10 seeds at ε ∈ {0.01, 0.05} for a stable
   estimate of the good-basin value and its hit rate.
